# GoFiggy Test Configurations

This repository contains sample configuration files in various formats. It is used for testing the [gofiggy](https://github.com/gofiggy/gofiggy) configuration server and client.

## Purpose

The primary goal is to provide diverse examples covering different file types, structures, nesting levels, and data types supported (or planned to be supported) by `gofiggy-server`.

## Structure

Configuration files are organized into directories named after their file type extension:

*   `/yaml/`
*   `/json/`
*   `/toml/`
*   `/ini/`
*   `/properties/`
*   `/xml/`
